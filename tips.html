        Starting things to know:
            <ul>
                <li>Monsters use increased experience values</li>
                <li>Torches can be thrown at enemies for 6-9 damage.  Fairy Waters can be thrown for 8-16 damage.</li>
                <li>All spells will be granted by level 16</li>
                <li>Monsters have skills and spells shuffled.  You can have a blue slime with Dragonlord breath, or a Red Dragon with HURT!</li>
                <li>Gold chests have been buffed and give 500-650 gold.</li>
                <li>Red Dragons and Golems have had their experience value increased to 350</li>
                <li>Goldmen have had their gold value increased to 650</li>
                <li>Enemies with spells roll between 0-9/16 STOPSPELL resistance decided at the start of the game, with more powerful enemies having a higher maximum</li>
                <li>Enemies will have no more than one defensive spell (STOPSPELL, SLEEP, HEAL, HEALMORE), and one offensive ability (HURT, HURTMORE, dragon breath, Dragonlord breath)</li>
                <li>Enemies with abilities will have a 25%/50%/75% of using that ability, decided at the start of the game</li>
                <li>Enemy priority is to attempt to use a defensive spell, attempt to use an offensive spell, then use a melee attack</li>
                <li>The Death Necklace grants 10 attack power at the cost of 25% of your HP.  You will want HP above 129 to consider using this</li>
                <li>The chest or search spot containing the Death Necklace will give 100-200 gold after the first loot.  If you don't take the Death Necklace, it's gone forever!</li>

            Monsters and Zones:<br>
            In each zone is five slots for possible encounters.
            Around Tantagel Castle will be "zone 0", containing monsters from Blue Slime to Scorpion.  Note that it is possible for the castle 
            itself to be on the edge of the zone!  Nearby will be "zone 1", containing monsters from Blue Slime to Wolf.  Once you've built a bit
            of stats, or found HURT, this is generally the next area to tackle.<br>  Charlock contains monsters ranging from Werewolf to Red Dragon.
            <br>
            Cave Zones:<br>
            The top of the Mountain Cave and the Swamp Cave share a zone, as does the second floor of Mountain and the first floor of the Grave of Garinham, and finally, the two bottom floors of Grave share a zone

            Slow Grind:  A slow grind involves going in and out of a cave (usually the Stones of Sunlight cave) repeatedly.
            Also occasionaly used to get keys.

            Gold Grind Glitch: To set up a gold grind glitch, you need to open nine chests without going to the overworld.  
            Revisiting the throne room counts the three chests that start in there, and count twice if you haven't left the castle for the first time.   
            The most common way is to open at least two chests in either 
            Garin's Grave or the Mountain Cave, die, then open the rest of the chests in the treasury in Tantagel
            until you reach eight chests, then open the gold chest repeatedly
            <br><br>
            Another way to do a gold grind glitch is if Garinham and Tantagel Castle are connected through the Swamp Cave.<br>
            First, find the gold chest you want to grind, either the back of Garinham or Tantagel.  Open the rest of the chests and visit the throne room,
            order doesn't matter.  Finally, open the gold chest as one of the last two.  <br>
            Although they're actually priced slightly less, 15000 gold for the Silver Shield, 8000 gold for the Magic Armor, and 10000 gold for the Flame Sword
            are easy numbers to remember (and 33000 for all three).

                Keeping Starting Key:  There are two ways to keep your starting key out of the throne room: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the RETURN spell</li>
                    <li>Use a pair of Wings if one of the first two chests had one</li>

            Save Split
            <br>
            A save split involves saving, then reloading the game.  The most common reason is to see what's in the treasury in Tantagel after
            doing a move that <a href="#wings">keeps your starting key</a> from the throne room.  Another reason is to keep your gold after
            doing a <a href="#gold_grind">gold grind</a> in case you run into a monster you can't kill or escape from<br>

            Notable Monsters
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Scorpion: The strongest enemy that can appear in the first zone near Tantagel Castle</li>
                <li>Metal Scorpion: Worth 31 xp, they have high defense but relatively low hp. If you can survive an attack from them, this makes them ideal targets for the HURT spell, Fairy Waters, or even throwing Torches.</li>
                <li>Wolf: The strongest enemy that can appear in the second zone, slightly farther from Tantagel Castle</li>
                <li>Magiwyvern: The strongest enemy that will always die to a single HURTMORE.</li>
                <li>Demon Knight: Will dodge 25% of your attacks.</li>
                <li>Werewolf: Has no HURTMORE resistance, but can tank through a single cast.  Weakest Charlock enemy</li>
                <li>Axe Knight: The strongest enemy that can (but not always) die to a single HURTMORE.  Has 1/16 resistance to HURTMORE.  Generally the ideal grind if you find one on a trap tile.</li>
                <li>Green Dragon: Similar to the Axe Knight, but has 1/8 HURTMORE resistance and will tank one cast fairly often.</li>
                <li>Stoneman: Weak to the SLEEP spell.  HURTMORE will affect him about half the time, but sometimes two HURTMOREs isn't enough</li>
                <li>Blue Dragon: Will also resist HURTMORE around half the time, but two HURTMOREs is enough.</li>
                <li>Golem: Vulerable to the Fairy Flute putting them to sleep.</li>
                <li>Armored Knight: Second hardest enemy to run from, but is vulnerable to two HURTMORES, or with enough attack power, a swing and a HURTMORE</li>
                <li>Red Dragon: Hardest enemy to run from, it's also the strongest outside of the Dragonlord himself.</li>    
            </ul>
