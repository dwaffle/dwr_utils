    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <div class="row instructions">
        You will need: 
        <ul>a copy of the US version of Dragon Warrior Randomzier.</ul>
        <ul>An NES emulator.  I personally use BizHawk.</ul>
        <ul>You can find these using your favorite search engine.</ul>
        Go to <a href="https://dwrandomizer.com">dwrandomizer.com</a> load in the ROM where it asks for the Rom File, and click Randomize!  You'll be given an NES rom, this is your randomized game.<br>
        The Checksum that's also generated is used for generating the same seed again, for example, in races.

        Beginning a game:
        <br>
        The goal is the same as it is in regular Dragon Warrior: find the Silver Harp, trade it in for the Staff of Rain, find the Stones of Sunlight and Erdrick's Token, and defeat the Dragonlord.<br>
        Along the way, you'll need to pick up Erdrick's Armor, most likely need Erdrick's Sword, and acquire enough HP, MP and Attack Power.<br>
        However, all the chests have been randomized, as well as the search spots in Kol, Hauksness and the coordinates.
        <br>
        Other things to know:
            <ul>
                <li>Monsters use the increased experience values from the remakes.</li>
                <li>Torches can be thrown at enemies for 6-9 damage.  Fairy Waters can be thrown for 8-16 damage.</li>
                <li>All spells will be granted by level 16</li>
                <li>Monsters have skills and spells shuffled.  You can have a blue slime with Dragonlord breath, or a Red Dragon with HURT!</li>
                <li>Red Dragons and Golems have had their experience value increased to 350</li>
                <li>Goldmen have had their gold value increased to 650</li>
